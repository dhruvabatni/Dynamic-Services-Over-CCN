Android Build System Notes
===========================

The build system is centered on gnu Make.  For Android projects, the
Makefile wraps the ant commands.

The android code depends on ccn.jar, so you must have run make in
the top level directory before buildin here.

Ccnd and the c-client library require OpenSSL library, which we need
to include build ourselves, as there is no apparant way to use the
included Android library.  As a result, we can use the latest 1.0.0a
library!

You must set the environment variables ANDROID_SDK and ANDROID_NDK.
These must point to the root of the SDK Tools R7 and NDK R4 (or later)
directories.  

For example:

	export ANDROID_SDK=~/android-sdk_r07-mac_x86
	export ANDROID_NDK=~/android-ndk-r4b

Android is not build as part of the top-level make.  You must run
make in this directory.

What happens
============

When you run "make" in the android directory, the build process takes
these steps:

- Build "external".
  This downloads the Openssl source, configures it for armv5, and
  does a patch.  It them puts Android.mk files in to the openssl
  source directories.  There is no actual compiling done.

  IF YOU DO NOT HAVE AN INTERNET CONNECTION
  You will need to download openssl-1.0.0a.tar.gz from 
	http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.0a.tar.gz
  and put it in the directory external/downloads.

- Build CCNx-Android-Services
  This wraps the ccnd and repo services.  Because ccnd is C code,
  it is included as JNI code, along with openssl.

  Doing a "make clean" will not erase the C object code.  Only
  a "make distclean" will get rid of it.

  The CCNx csrc/ folder now has Android.mk files in it already, so
  the CCNx-Android-Services/jni folder has a link to csrc/.  We have
  also include csrc/ccnd/android_{main,msg}.c.  android_main.c replaces
  ccnd_main.c in Android.mk and is used to startup ccnd procedurally
  rather than from a main() method.  android_msg.c replaces ccnd_msg.c
  in Android.mk and sends ccnd log messages to the Android log.

  Take a look in jni/controller/ctl_ccnd.c for the JNI bindings to
  the ccnd code.

- Build the apps/ directory

Installing
===========

"make install" will install the Services and Chat applications.  You
might need to "make unistall" before "make install" if the applications
were previously installed with a different signing key (i.e. you use
the phone with builds from multiple computers).
