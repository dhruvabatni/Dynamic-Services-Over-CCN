Android Apps for CCNx
=====================

CCNx-Android-Lib
  This is an Android library.  It has helpers for the ccnd and 
  repo services, among other things.  No build is done here, as
  Android libraries are included in source form.

Before you use any CCNx library calls:
- Call CCNxConfiguration.config(Context)
- Call CCNxServiceControl.startAll() or startAllBackround()

Once you have configured your environment (config()) and started
ccnd and the repo (startAll()), you can then use the
CCNx library.

You application needs these permissions:
	# Always need this:
    android.permission.INTERNET

	# If your keystore is on /sdcard
    android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

Important Notes
===============
- User keys are stored in /sdcard/ccnx/user
  Because this is on the SD card, it may become unavailable if you
  plug in your usb and use the SD card for storage.  

  The user keysore is on the sdcard so multiple apps from different packages
  can share the same identity.

  If your app wants to use a private keystore, call

- Repo directory is /sdcard/ccnx/repo
  See User note about /sdcard

- Ccnd directory is under the apk:
  /data/data/org.ccnx.android.services/app_ccnd
