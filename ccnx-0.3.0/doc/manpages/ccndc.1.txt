CCNDC(1)
========

NAME
----
ccndc - manipulate CCNx forwarding table

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccndc* [-v] -d 

*ccndc* [-v] -f 'configfile' 

*ccndc* [-v] add 'uri' (udp|tcp) 'host' ['port' [flags [mcastttl [mcastif]]]])

*ccndc* [-v] del 'uri' (udp|tcp) 'host' ['port' [flags [mcastttl [mcastif]]]])

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*ccndc* is a simple routing utility/daemon that configures the forwarding
table (FIB) in a *ccnd(1)*. It may be used either as a command to add
or remove static entries in the CCNx FIB (roughly analogous to
the *route(8)* utility for manipulating an IP routing table). It may
also run as a daemon that will dynamically create Faces and FIB
entries to forward certain CCNx Interests based upon DNS SRV
records. The Interests that can be dynamically routed in this way are
those have an initial name component that is a legal DNS name, for
which there is a DNS SRV record pointing to an endpoint for tunneling
CCNx protocol traffic over the Internet.

*ccndc* also supports configuration files containing sets of `add` and
 `del` commands.


OPTIONS
-------

*-d*:: 
       enter dynamic mode and create FIB entries based on DNS SRV records

*-f*:: 
       add or delete FIB entries based on contents of 'configfile'

*-v*:: 
       increase logging level

*add* 'uri' (udp|tcp) 'host' ['port' [flags [mcastttl [mcastif]]]])::
      add a FIB entry based on the parameters

*del* 'uri' (udp|tcp) 'host' ['port' [flags [mcastttl [mcastif]]]])::
      delete a FIB entry based on the parameters


CONFIGURATION FILE
------------------

*ccndc* will process a configuration file if specified with the *-f*
flag. The configuration file may contain a sequence of `add` and `del`
commands with the same parameters as may be specified on the *ccndc*
command-line.  Comments in the file are prefixed with `#`.  Here is a
sample:

	 # Sample ccnd.conf for use with ccndc that will route all CCN URIs with
	 # an example.com prefix to a link-local multicast on an ephemeral port.
	 # 
	 add ccnx:/example.com/ udp 224.0.0.204 52428


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success

*1*::
     Failure (syntax or usage error; communication error)
