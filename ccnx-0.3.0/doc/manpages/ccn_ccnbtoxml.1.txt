CCN_CCNBTOXML(1)
================

NAME
----
ccn_ccnbtoxml - convert ccn binary encoded data into XML form

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccn_ccnbtoxml* [-bvx] [-d 'dict'] [-s 'pat'] 'file' '...'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ccn_ccnbtoxml* converts ccn binary encoded data into XML form.

OPTIONS
-------
*-b*::
	Force base64Binary (or hexBinary if used with -x) instead of preferring text where possible.

*-d* 'dict'::
	Augment the built-in DTAG dictionary with the named file (format like tagname.csvdict).
	May be repeated.

*-v*::
	Verbose - add comments with alternative encodings.

*-x*::
	Prefer hexBinary over the default of base64Binary.

*-s* 'pat'::
	Split concatenated ccnb blocks into separate output files, using 'pat' to generate output files named 'pat00000.xml', 'pat00001.xml', ...

ARGUMENTS
---------
The named files should contain ccnb-encoded data.
Use *-* to specify standard input.

OUTPUT
------
The XML form appears on standard output, unless the *-s* switch is used; status and diagnostic messages appear on standard error.

The output is produced in a compact form.
For more human-readable, it is often useful to pipe the output through *xmllint --format -*.

By default, BLOB fields are turned into base64Binary if they are not expressible in a safe subset of ascii printable characters.
If hexBinary is preferred, use the *-x* switch.
In any case, a ccnbencoding attribute is added to the enclosing element to indicate which display encoding is being used for the BLOB.

If you want to check the XML to make sure it conforms to a schema, use the *-b* switch to force base64Binary (because the schemas current assume that).

The output may be converted back into ccnb form using the *ccn_xmltoccnb* utility.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success

*nonzero*::
     Failure (syntax or usage error, file not found)
