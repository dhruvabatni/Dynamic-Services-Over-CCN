This directory contains man page documentation for tools.  

The source is asciidoc. The derived formats are HTML, PDF, and man
page.

Note that even with asciidoc you may be missing the required xmlto
program because of poor asciidoc package dependencies and the
diagnostics in this case are not very helpful.

Source Authoring notes:
- You will get an error if the underlining segments (=== or ---) don't match 
  line above in length
- The manpage document type requires content in sections so don't leave one
  blank.  This includes something after the "-" in the NAME section
- When copying the template, change the first word under NAME immediately 
  to the name of the manpage because that is what will be used in the filename
  of (at least some) derived files.
