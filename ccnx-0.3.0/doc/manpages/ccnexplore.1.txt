CCNEXPLORE(1)
=============

NAME
----
ccnexplore - Java Swing GUI to explore content stored in repositories

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccnexplore* [-root 'ccnxname'] [-accessControl] [-debugMode]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ccnexplore* utility is an experimental app still under development. This
application explores available ContentObjects using the CCNx Java application,
ContentExplorer and defaults to '/' as the starting point for displaying
content and starting name enumeration. *ccnexplore* uses CCNNameEnumeration to
populate the GUI and can open .txt and .text files in a preview pane or
separate window. The ContentExplorer can also be used to store files in a
repository (using the Save to Repo button). To override the default starting
point, run with the '-root' flag with a 'ccnxname'. *ccnxeplore* is intended
to be used as a first test of AccessControl functionality with CCN. This is
in an extremely early state and will be updated in future releases.
*ccnexplore* can also be used to fully explore the name hierarchy of objects
stored in the repositories.  If run with the '-debugMode' all ContentName
components, including versions, segments and digests, will be displayed. 

OPTIONS
-------
*-root* 'ccnxname'::
	Set a starting 'ccnxname' prefix to display in the GUI and immediately begin enumerating.  This allows the user to avoid clicking through the full prefix to begin displaying files under the prefix in the GUI.

*-accessControl*::
	Allow testing and experimentation with the initial access control code.

*-debugMode*::
	Allow the GUI to enumerate past ContentName versions and segments.  This is useful for debugging content in the repository, especially the access control content objects.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success

*1*::
     Failure (syntax or usage error; enumeration error)
