.SS "int ccn_seqw_batch_start (struct ccn_seqwriter * w)"
.PP
Start a batch of writes. This will delay the signing of content objects until the batch ends, producing a more efficient result. Must have a matching \fBccn_seqw_batch_end()\fP call. Batching may be nested.

.RS 4
\fIname\fP is a ccnb-encoded Name. It will be provided with a version based on the current time unless it already ends in a version component.

.SS "int ccn_seqw_possible_interest (struct ccn_seqwriter * w)"
.PP
Assert that an interest has possibly been expressed that matches the seqwriter's data. This is useful, for example, if the seqwriter was created in response to an interest. 
.PP
Definition at line 258 of file ccn_seqwriter.c.
.SS "int ccn_seqw_write (struct ccn_seqwriter * w, const void * buf, size_t size)"
.PP
Write some data to a seqwriter. This is roughly analogous to a write(2) call in non-blocking mode.
.PP
The current implementation returns an error and refuses the new data if it does not fit in the current buffer. That is, there are no partial writes. In this case, the caller should \fBccn_run()\fP for a little while and retry.
.PP
It is also an error to attempt to write more than 4096 bytes.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the size written, or -1 for an error. In case of an error, the caller may test \fBccn_geterror()\fP for values of EAGAIN or EINVAL from errno.h.
