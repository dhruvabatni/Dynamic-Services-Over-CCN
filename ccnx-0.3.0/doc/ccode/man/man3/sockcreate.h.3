.PP
Utility for setting up a socket (or pair of sockets) from a text-based description. Currently this is only used for UDP multicast.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIdescr\fP hold the information needed to create the socket(s). 
.br
\fIlogger\fP should be used for reporting errors, printf-style. 
.br
\fIlogdat\fP must be passed as first argument to \fBlogger()\fP. 
.br
\fIgetbound\fP is callback for getting already-bound sender socket, should return -1 if none. 
.br
\fIgetbounddat\fP is passed as first argument to getbound 
.br
\fIsocks\fP will be filled in with the pair of socket file descriptors.
