.SS "void ccn_dispatch_message (struct ccn * h, unsigned char * msg, size_t size)"
.PP
Dispatch a message through the registered upcalls. This is not used by normal ccn clients, but is made available for use when ccnd needs to communicate with its internal client. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIh\fP is the ccn handle. 
.br
\fImsg\fP is the ccnb-encoded Interest or ContentObject. 
.br
\fIsize\fP is its size in bytes.

.SS "void ccn_setup_sockaddr_un (const char * portstr, struct sockaddr_un * result)"
.PP
Set up a unix-domain socket address for contacting ccnd. If the environment variable CCN_LOCAL_SOCKNAME is set and not empty, it supplies the name stem; otherwise the compiled-in default is used.
.PP
If portstr is NULL or empty, the environment variable CCN_LOCAL_PORT is checked. If the portstr specifies something other than the ccnx registered port number, the socket name is modified accordingly. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIportstr\fP - numeric port; use NULL for default.
