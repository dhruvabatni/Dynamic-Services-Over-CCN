CCNx URI Scheme
===============

== CCNx URI Scheme
   * Please refer to RFC 3986 (URI Generic Syntax) for background
   * The scheme identifier is "ccnx".
   * When producing a URI from a CCNx Name, only the generic URI unreserved characters are left unescaped.  These are the US-ASCII upper and lower case letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and the four specials PLUS (+), PERIOD (.), UNDERSCORE (_), and HYPHEN (-).  All other characters are escaped using the percent-encoding method of the URI Generic Syntax.
   * To unambiguously represent name components that would collide with the use of . and .. for relative URIs, any component that consists solely of zero or more periods is encoded using three additional periods.  Note that this means the zero-length component is encoded as three periods "...".
   * The authority component (the part after the initial "//" in the familiar http and ftp URI schemes) is not really relevant to CCNx.  It should normally not be present, and it is ignored if it is present.
