Implicit Digest Component
=========================

The *implicit digest component* consists the SHA-256 digest of the entire ccnb-encoded link:ContentObject.html[ContentObject].

The reasoning behind this is that we want to be able to do both of the following:

. Link to one specific ContentObject and no other.
. Exclude a specific ContentObject in an interest (whether or not it has a valid signature).
