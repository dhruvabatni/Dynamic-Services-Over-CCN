After installing ubuntu-8.10-desktop-i386.iso and applying all updates,
to build ccnd it was necessary to install these packages:

libssl-dev
libpcap-dev
libexpat1-dev

These are also desirable:
athena-jot

For example:
sudo apt-get install git-core python-dev libssl-dev libpcap-dev libexpat1-dev athena-jot
