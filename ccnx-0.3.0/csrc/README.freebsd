CCNx csrc/README for FreeBSD

It is possible to build the c portions of CCNx 
on FreeBSD 7 or newer without any software beyond
that provided in the base system.

It is recommended, though, that the expat package be
installed, because the xml support in the base system
is not intended for add-on software.

pkg_add -rv expat

Having libxml2 available allows the schema validations
to run, but it is not required to build the code.

pkg_add -rv libxml2

To build the basic documentation, install asciidoc (this
will end up installing python and bash as well).

pkg_add -rv asciidoc

If you want to build the full documentation, you'll need
to install doxygen.

pkg_add -rv doxygen

For access to sources via git:
pkg_add -rv git

For FreeBSD 8.0-RELEASE-p2, after installing the above
(except for git and doxygen) these were the installed packages:
bash-4.0.33         The GNU Project's Bourne Again SHell
expat-2.0.1         XML 1.0 parser written in C
gettext-0.17_1      GNU gettext package
libiconv-1.13.1     A character set conversion library
libxml2-2.7.5       XML parser library for GNOME
pkg-config-0.23_1   A utility to retrieve information about installed libraries
python26-2.6.2_3    An interpreted object-oriented programming language
