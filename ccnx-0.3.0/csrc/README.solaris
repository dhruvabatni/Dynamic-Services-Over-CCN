Required software for building CCNx on Solaris:

	GNU make (usually /usr/bin/gmake or /usr/sfw/bin/gmake)
	GNU install (usually /usr/bin/ginstall or /usr/sfw/bin/ginstall)
	Sun Studio C compiler
		Tested with Studio 11, should work with Studio 12.
		See http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/downloads/previous/index.jsp
		Versions are available on OpenSolaris through the IPS repository.

A future release will likely include a configuration file for using GNU cc.
You might have some success creating a csrc/conf/local.mk containing

	CC = gcc
	PLATCFLAGS=-fPIC
	CWARNFLAGS = -Wall -Wpointer-arith -Wreturn-type -Wstrict-prototypes
	CPREFLAGS= -I../include -D_REENTRANT

before you run "configure"
