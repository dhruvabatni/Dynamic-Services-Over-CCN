To build on Darwin, we require at least OpenSSL 0.9.8, installed in
/opt/local.  Leopard (Mac OS 10.5) ships with 0.9.7.

One option is to istall it using MacPorts.

If you do not want to use MacPorts, try this:
Make sure /opt/local exists:  "mkdir -p /opt/local"
Then download openssl-0.9.8 from www.openssl.org, then configure it with

  ./Configure shared --prefix=/opt/local darwin-i386-cc
