# This is a wrapper that logs each git command issued.  It can be helpful
# for figuring out what you might have done to confuse git, or to make
# git confuse you.
# 
# To use it, copy this script to a safe place (for example ~/bin/gitwrap) and
# edit your .profile (or .bash_profile) to create an alias that will
# invoke the script instead of the real executable:
#   [ -x ~/bin/gitwrap ] && alias git=~/bin/gitwrap
#
# (If you use csh or a variant, the details will differ.)
#
# Note that this is not specific to CCNx develpment - your commands will be
# logged for all of your git projects.
#

# The real git location (edit if necessary)
REALGIT=/usr/bin/git

# Where we want to log
LOGFILE=~/.gitcommand.log

# Use seconds since epoch for a time stamp; easy to sort.
