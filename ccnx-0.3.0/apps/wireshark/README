In order to build the CCN plugin for Wireshark you will first need to install
a Wireshark source distribution.

Then -- in your wireshark source directory you should make a symlink from
wireshark/plugins/ccn to the ccn/apps/wireshark/ccn directory
of the CCN distribution.

You'll need to follow the instructions in wireshark file doc/README.plugins
regarding existing Wireshark files that need to be edited to add a new plugin.

For wireshark 1.0.7, you need to fix the following files (README.plugins sec 3)

	configure.in
	epan/Makefile.am
	Makefile.am
	Makefile.nmake
	packaging/nsis/Makefile.nmake
	packaging/nsis/wireshark.nsi
	plugins/Makefile.am
	plugins/Makefile.nmake

When you've made the changes per README.plugins, you must run wireshark's
autogen.sh and configure to setup your wireshark build area, and then
recompile wireshark.
