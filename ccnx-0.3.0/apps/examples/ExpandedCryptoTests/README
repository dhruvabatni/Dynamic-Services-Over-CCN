This directory contains additional JUnit tests that either require
algorithms not available on all platforms and configurations, or
require that your Java installation be configured to support
unlimited-strength crypto. We want to make our "out of the box"
test configuration as general as possible, so don't require that
either of these conditions be met to run the standard tests; hence
the separation of this code from the main library tests. 

We keep these tests because we want to both test this functionality 
on platforms that do support it, and demonstrate how to use various
crypto-related classes with algorithms other than RSA.
