The vlc plugin code provided is known to work with the 0.9.9 releases.

In order to compile the vlc plugin you will need to install
the vlc and libvlc-dev packages.  On Ubuntu Linux, for example,
you can use:

# apt-get install vlc libvlc-dev

On Mac OS X, you can use macports to install VLC:

$ sudo port install VLC


Two system-dependent makefiles are provided, Makefile.Linux and Makefile.OSX.
In the apps/vlc directory, make a symlink that reflects the
appropriate one for your system, e.g.

$ ln -s Makefile.Linux Makefile

If you have not already compiled the CCN library, do so:

$ ( cd ../.. && ./configure && make )

Now compile the vlc plugin and install it:

$ make 
$ sudo make install

The CCN vlc plugin Makefile makes use of the pkg-config info
to locate the necessary vlc include files, and the correct
directory in which to install the vlc access plugins.

Note that to vlc, a CCN URI must start ccnx:/// (because of the URI parser in VLC).
