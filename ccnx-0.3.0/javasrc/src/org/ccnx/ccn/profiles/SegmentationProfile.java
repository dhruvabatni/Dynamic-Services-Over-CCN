/**
 * We speak in terms of segments, not fragments, as this profile
 * also encompasses packet-oriented data with sequenced segments rather
 * than block data divided into fragments.
 * Sequence/segment numbers occupy the final component of the CCN name 
 * (again, not counting the digest component). For consecutive numbering, 
 * the first byte of the sequence component is 0x00. The remaining bytes 
 * hold the sequence number in big-endian unsigned binary, using the minimum number 
 * of bytes. Thus sequence number 0 is encoded in just one byte, %00, and 
 * sequence number 1 is %00%01. Note that this encoding is not quite 
 * dense - %00%00 is unused, as are other components that start with 
 * these two bytes. 
 * For non-consecutive numbering (e.g, using byte offsets) the value 
 * 0xFB may be used as a marker.
