/**
 * A CCNInputStream that reads and writes versioned streams.
 * Names are versioned using the VersioningProfile. If you
 * ask to open a name that is already versioned, it opens that
 * version for you. If you ask to open a name without a version,
 * it attempts to open the latest version of that name. If you
 * attempt to open a name with a segment marker on it as well,
 * it opens that version of that content at that segment.
 * 
 * The only behavior we have to change from superclass is that
 * involved in getting the first segment -- header or regular segment.
 * We need to make an interest that gets the latest version, and
 * then fills in the version information on the name we
 * are working with, to make sure we continue to get blocks
 * from the same version (even if, say someone writes another
 * version on top of us).
