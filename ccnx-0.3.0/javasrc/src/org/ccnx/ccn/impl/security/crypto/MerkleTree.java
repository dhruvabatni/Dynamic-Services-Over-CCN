/**
 * Implementation of a Merkle hash tree. 
 * 
 * Representation based on Knuth, Vol 1, section 2.3.4.5. We represent
 * trees as a special sublcass of extended binary
 * trees, where empty subtrees are only present in one end
 * of the tree.
 * 
 * Tree nodes are numbered starting with 1, which is the
 * root. 
 * 
 * Tree nodes are stored in an array, with node i stored at index
 * i-1 into the array.
 * 
 * Incomplete binary trees are represented as multi-level extended
 * binary trees -- lower-numbered leaves are represented in the
 * upper half of the tree, in a layer one closer to the root than
 * leaves in the complete subtree.
 * 
 * Total number of nodes in the tree = 2n + 1, where n is the number of leaves.
 * 
 * Taken in terms of node indices (where root == 1), the parent
 * of node k is node floor(k/2), and the children of node k are
 * nodes 2k and 2k+1. Leaves are numbered from node n+1 through 
 * 2n+1, where n is the number of leaves.
 * 
 * The sibling index of node k is (k xor 1).
 * 
 * Should we want to get fancy, we could have t-ary trees; the
 * construction above works for tree with internal nodes (non-leaves)
 * {1,2,...,n}.
 * 
 * The parent of node k is the node floor((k+t-2)/t) = ceil((k-1)/t).
 * The children of node k are:
 * t(k-1)+2, t(k-1)+3,..., tk+1
 * 
 * In the methods below, we refer to nodes as having a "nodeIndex" -- their
 * 1-based index into the node array as described above. Leaf nodes also have
 * a "leafIndex" -- their index into the set of n leaves. Convenience
 * methods are provided to convert between the two.
 * 
 * Store node digests internally as DEROctetStrings for more efficient
 * encoding.
