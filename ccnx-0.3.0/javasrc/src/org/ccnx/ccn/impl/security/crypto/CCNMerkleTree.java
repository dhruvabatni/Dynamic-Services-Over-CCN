/**
 * Extends the basic MerkleTree for use in CCN.
 * It incorporates the CCN ContentName for an object at each node, so that
 * names are authenticated as well as content in a
 * way that intermediary CCN nodes can verify.
 * 
 * For each leaf node in the CCNMerkleTree, we compute its
 * digest in exactly the same way we would compute the digest of a ContentObject
 * node for signing on its own (incorporating the name, authentication metadata,
 * and content). We then combine all these leaf digests together into a MerkleTree,
 * and sign the root node.
 * 
 * To generate a leaf block digest, therefore, we need to know
 * - the content of the block
 * - the name for the block (which, for segmented content, includes the segmented
 * 	   number. If we're buffering content and building trees per buffer, the
 * 	   fragment numbers may carry across buffers (e.g. leaf 0 of this tree might
 *     be fragment 37 of the content as a whole)
 *     
 * - the authentication metadata. In the case of fragmented content, this is
 *     likely to be the same for all blocks. In the case of other content, the
 *     publisher is likely to be the same, but the timestamp and even maybe the
 *     type could be different -- i.e. you could use a CCNMerkleTree to amortize
 *     signature costs over any collection of data, not just a set of fragments.
 *     
 * So, we either need to hand in all the names, or have a function to call to get
 * the name for each block.
 * 
 * Note: There is no requirement that a CCNMerkleTree be built only from the segments
 *     of a single piece of content, although that is the most common use. One
 *     can build and verify a CCNMerkleTree built out of an arbitrary set of
 *     ContentObjects; this may be a useful way of limiting the number of
 *     signatures generated on constrained platforms. Eventually the CCNSegmenter
 *     will be extended to handle such collections of arbitrary objects.
 *
