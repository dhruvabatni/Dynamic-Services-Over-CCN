/**
 * An aggregated signer takes a set of blocks and computes signatures
 * over them such that each block can be verified individually.
 * An example aggregated signer computes a Merkle hash tree over
 * the component blocks and then constructs signatures for each.
 * 
 * Signing can be a computationally expensive operation; aggregated
 * signing mitigates this.
 * 
 * This could be a base abstract class or an interface; the former
 * would have a set of constructors or static factory methods that
 * made an object returning blocks. Instead, we try an interface
 * that has a set of bulk put methods which construct blocks, put
 * them to the network, and return an individual ContentObject.
