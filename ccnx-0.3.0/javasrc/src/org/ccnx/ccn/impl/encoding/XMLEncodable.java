/**
 * Top-level interface implemented by objects that want to make use of our stream encoding
 * and decoding infrastructure. Note - this uses a compact binary encoding (ccnb) normally
 * rather than text XML.
 * 
 * The choice between compact binary encoding and text encoding is made for the
 * general case using a system-wide configuration parameter set in SystemConfiguration.
 * Subclasses wishing to can use this infrastructure for encoding/decoding objects that
 * should be read/edited by users can force their particular subtype to always use
 * the text encoding; or callers that read/write that data can specify the text encoding
 * when reading or writing. The latter is the better option, as it allows the underlying
 * content to use the compact binary encoding in settings where that would be preferable,
 * without needing to modify the code. See GenericXMLEncodable#toString()
 * for an example.
 * 
 * Most classes wishing to make use of this infrastructure will do so by subclassing
 * GenericXMLEncodable, which provides default implementations of almost all of the necessary
 * behavior, leaving very little work for the class implementor to do. For examples,
 * see existing subclasses of GenericXMLEncodable.
